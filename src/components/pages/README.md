# Page structure

- This is only in the eyes of the doctor and will eventually need to be usable by the pharmacist
- Each page has its own folder. It has an index.js file that exports the page. We can also place unit tests inside these folders.

## Landing Page

- First page that appears. Allows for signup and signin

## Dashboard

- For now (and according to the Figma design), this will be after the landing page (i.e. Aadhar Search)

## Patient Profile

- After the user is searched by the medical professional

## Not Found

- A simple, 404 page
