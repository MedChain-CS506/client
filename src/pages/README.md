# Page structure

- Note, I am setting up the pages now, but plan to make them more modular with reusable components (e.g. navbar).
- This is also only in the eyes of the doctor. This'll eventually need to also be usable for the pharmacist

## Landing Page

- First page that appears. Allows for signup and signin

## Dashboard

- For now (and according to the Figma design), this will be after the landing page (i.e. Aadhar Search)

## Patient Profile

- After the user is searched by the medical professional

## Not Found

- A simple, 404 page
